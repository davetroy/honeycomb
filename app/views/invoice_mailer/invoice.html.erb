Hi <%=@person.first_name%>,</p>

<p>Your membership contribution due now is currently <%= number_to_currency(@owed)%>.</p>

<p>You can pay this amount now using Paypal by visiting <%= link_to("this link",new_payment_url(:person_id => @person, :amount => @owed)) %>.</p>

<p><b>HEY, THIS IS NEW AND IMPORTANT:</b> Effective February 5, 2011, we are using PayPal Subscriptions to handle payments for
<b>all</b> Beehive memberships; you will only receive payment requests when your balance exceeds the amount covered by your Paypal subscription.
Please <a href="http://beehivebaltimore.org">click here</a> to initiate your monthly subscription!

<p>Remember, Beehive is more than just workspace, it's a community! And your contribution helps fuel the
  <b>entire</b> tech freelance and startup community in Baltimore. The ecosystem relies on your continued support. Any funds generated in excess of our
  rent costs go <strong>directly</strong> into building the community here in Baltimore through events and infrastructure.

<% if @owed>200 %>
<p>If you don't think the amount above is correct, please reply to this email and we'll help sort it out.</p>
<% end %>

<p>Thanks for supporting community coworking in Baltimore, and we will see you around the Hive soon!</p>

Sincerely,<p/>

<strong>Beehive Baltimore</strong>
